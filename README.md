# GameProject, Evan Sturtevant

This project is for my Seminar and Research as part of my computer science degree at Juniata College.
The goal of the project was to was to create a video game that reacted to players choices and provide a unique player experience per the player's playstyle.
Further information regarding the purpose of the game can be found in the research proposal.

Currently this project is still being worked on and is not complete. This can explain bugs and the lack of polish.
